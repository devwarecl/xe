XE will be a platform for building high-performance, cross-platform multimedia applications,
based on a layered architecture. 

The first layer (called XE.Core) is currently on development and offers:

* Mathematical functions and structures.
* Low-level abstractions to Memory, Streams, Archives, Graphics, Audio and Input handling.
